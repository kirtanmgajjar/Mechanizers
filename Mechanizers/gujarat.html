    <h1> PAHAL-Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG (DBTL)
    </h1>

    <div> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  LPG in India is provided at subsidized rates, ensuring that people can afford it. The typical subsidy amount ranges between Rs.160 and Rs.170 per cylinder, helping people save a considerable sum each year. Given the numbers involved, there was a provision for misuse of the subsidy amount, which is why the government introduced the PAHAL or Direct Benefit Transfer of LPG Scheme. PAHAL or Pratyaksh Hanstantrit Labh Scheme aims to provide direct benefits to consumers.
        The scheme, which was originally introduced in 2013 was relaunched to cover the entire country. As per the scheme, LPG consumers can get the subsidy amount directly into their bank account, eliminating the need for any third party.
